      <h2 id="today-i-am-bold">Today I Am Bold</h2>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s about time I got to this! Welcome to my first development log about a mobile app I&rsquo;m working on titled &lsquo;I Am&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a concept I&rsquo;ve had for quite some time, and it&rsquo;s turning out to be a great starter project. Rather than go deep into the details right away, I want to start by sharing a little about the project - what it is, my development goals, and some of the roadblocks I expect to encounter along the way (and some I&rsquo;ve already had trouble with!).</p>
<h2 id="i-am---the-concept">I Am - The Concept</h2>
<p>I Am is a simple app with a simple premise. Life is stressful, and that stress can sap away our energy. When that happens, it&rsquo;s nice to have a little pick-me-up to help us work through the challenges in front of us and get back to feeling like ourselves again. I Am wants to be your daily pick-me-up, and it will do it in a pretty straightforward way.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Today I am [adjective]&quot;</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sentence you&rsquo;ll see on the main page of the app, nice and large in the middle of your phone&rsquo;s screen. Except, of course, you&rsquo;ll see an actual adjective at the end - bold, adventurous, friendly&hellip; there&rsquo;s a whole list to select from! Whichever word you choose, you&rsquo;re setting an emotional goal for yourself, something that can be used as a personal mantra and can help you find a way to keep moving forward when times are tough.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an early look at how things are going:</p>

<h2 id="main-project-goals">Main Project Goals</h2>
<h3 id="build-ship-and-update-a-xamarinforms-app">Build, Ship, and Update a Xamarin.Forms App</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking into Xamarin.Forms on and off for a few years now, and I&rsquo;m taking this chance to build an app from start to release and beyond. I love the idea that I could build an app for iOS, Android, and more using the same codebase. Multiplatform projects are definitely big in the future of development, and it&rsquo;s time I got familiar with it.</p>
<p>By the end of this, I expect to have a much better understanding of Xamarin.Forms, some aspects of native platform configuration, debugging, publishing, and pushing updates to a live Xamarin app - the whole project lifecycle with Xamarin. Then the second app will come out much faster!</p>
<h3 id="endless-localization-support">&lsquo;Endless&rsquo; Localization Support</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been <strong>super heavy</strong> into localization this year, and I&rsquo;m trying hard to build up the skills and experience to get a job as a localization engineer. I think it&rsquo;s important to be aware of the different audiences that use a product, and I really support the goal of speaking to people in their language on their terms. So I&rsquo;m going to localize the hell out of this app!</p>
<p>While I do have a few target locales in mind - en-US, es-ES, vi-VN, and ja-JP - I actually have a very open-ended plan for localization. I&rsquo;ll do what I can on my end to internationalize the app&rsquo;s layout and text display in preparation for string localization, and from there I plan on crowdsourcing translations through collaborative online tools. Hopefully (<em>fingers crossed</em>), I can slot in translated resources without many issues. If that works out, I intend to keep adding languages indefinitely as long as I can find translators to support them.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-and-roadblocks">Challenges and Roadblocks</h2>
<p>No project is without challenges, but they&rsquo;re also how we find and overcome limitations. Here are some roadblocks I&rsquo;ve already run into along with one that I fully expect to be an issue down the line.</p>
<h3 id="visual-studio-for-mac">Visual Studio for Mac</h3>
<p>I <strong>love</strong> that Visual Studio for Mac exists because I can work on my MacBook Air anywhere in the world I want. I <strong>don&rsquo;t love</strong> that VS for Mac sometimes feels like a lower priority than the Windows version when it comes to feature support and bug fixes.</p>
<p>For example, the huge majority of VS extensions are only available on Windows, mostly due to the use of  code libraries like WPF that don&rsquo;t work on a Mac. This isn&rsquo;t really anybody&rsquo;s fault, specifically. It just means that I constantly find tools recommendations or even Microsoft-sponsored tutorials that show me tools I can&rsquo;t use on a Mac.</p>
<p>Yes, VS for Mac is <em>beautifully designed</em> (much nicer than Windows, I think), but my tools are limited. I was especially surprised when I found out the .resx editor available for editing resources files on Windows was missing from Mac entirely. Before I found my online translation tools, I was editing multiple .resx files <strong>by hand.</strong> 😱</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t I just work on Windows? Simple - I need a Mac to build the iOS app. Even if I started on Windows with all the nice toolsets, they wouldn&rsquo;t build on a Mac, so I simply can&rsquo;t use them if I intend to build anything on a Mac. It&rsquo;s fine, though. I see this as an opportunity to discover and develop strong Mac-friendly workflows that I can use in other projects.</p>
<h3 id="localization-with-xamarin">Localization with Xamarin</h3>
<p>Building a localization system was a challenge for some time as well. Remember all the VS extensions I can&rsquo;t use on Mac? Well, I had to build something on my own. There is <strong>very little</strong> <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/localization/"  target="_blank" >official documentation on localization</a> (though it&rsquo;s sometimes very helpful), and it seems very few people have tried to tackle the subject in blogs and forums. I might have know that localization isn&rsquo;t such a hot topic. However, I did find a workable solution that I&rsquo;ll be writing about in another post.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a bit concerned about testing with pseudo-localization. I honestly don&rsquo;t know how to do it, and I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a way to do it properly in a Xamarin app. This requires some research.</p>
<h3 id="auto-sizing-label-fonts">Auto Sizing Label Fonts</h3>
<p>I never thought this would be an issue, but it was an absolutely devilish one that completely stalled my progress for around a month. It turns out there&rsquo;s currently no built-in Xamarin support for setting the font size of a label to fill up as much space as it can. It <em>sounds</em> like such a basic thing, but I found out the hard way that it really isn&rsquo;t. But hey, when you want your text to fill up the screen, you have to figure out a way to make it happen. <a href="/posts/i-am-dev-log/part-2-xamarin-font-auto-sizing/" >I’ll show you how I did it in a different post.</a></p>
<hr>
<p>That&rsquo;s the rundown so far! Perhaps I&rsquo;ve teased more than I&rsquo;ve explained, but I certainly plan on sharing more about I Am&rsquo;s development in future posts. Tomorrow I continue building, but today I&rsquo;m excited to share my goals and aspirations, to risk the creator&rsquo;s humiliation that we all feel when sharing the fruits of our labor. Today I&rsquo;m putting it out there.</p>
<p><strong>Today I am bold.</strong></p>
