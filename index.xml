      <description>What will this year&amp;rsquo;s theme be???</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s that time of year again! 25 days of mind-bending code challenges brought to you by <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022">Advent of Code 2022!</a> Last year I ended up getting <em>most</em> of the way through, but who knows this year? I&rsquo;m a hell of a lot busier (read: employed) this time around, and I do have a backlog of posts from this year that I want to get out there for you. Or maybe for me. Whoever they benefit, really.</p>
<p>But I actually did some prep work this year! I built a little <code>Solution</code> wrapper class to manage printing my outputs and tracking execution time, and I created files for all 25 days ahead of time - just need to update their titles as I unlock the challenges. And the best thing about having done this challenge before is that I had some data models and functions I could steal from! Last year, I put most of my efforts into building an input reader and some 2D and 3D coordinate objects with some nice computation functions included. No need to reinvent the wheel - they&rsquo;re coming along for the ride!</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll fill up the list below with links to my solutions, maybe once a week so I don&rsquo;t have to keep updating all the time. Feel like sharing your AoC projects? toss a link in the comments! Happy holidays, y&rsquo;all. ðŸŽ„ ðŸŽ… ðŸŽ„ ðŸŽ… ðŸŽ„</p>

      <title>WilyKit: The MacBook That Became Wall Art</title>
      <link>https://www.adamormsby.com/posts/014-old-laptop-disassembly/</link>

      <description>After 8 years of service, my 2013 MacBook Air finally died last year. I had always planned on keeping the lid somehow, so I took it apart and turned it into wall art.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Computers get old and die just like us. Parts fail. They become obsolete. You drop them a few too many times. It happens to <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j_WpEYAAmi8/maxresdefault.jpg">the best of us.</a> And while there are many ways to dispose of your computer - like <a href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle/electronics-donation-and-recycling">donation and recycling</a> - it can sometimes feel like letting go of a friend. I felt that way about WilyKit, so I turned it into wall art. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>After 8 years of service, my 2013 MacBook Air finally died last year. Simple hard drive failure, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Air+13-Inch+Mid+2013+Solid-State+Drive+Replacement/15181">totally fixable for a hundred bucks.</a> But I needed a more powerful computer to help with my work, so I just bought a new one instead.</p>
<p>I had always planned on keeping the lid somehow, no matter how many times its dinged-up edges caught onto my bags, my clothes, and even my skin when they were feeling extra bloodthirsty. It was just so full of memories! I took that laptop around the world, wrote stories with it, learned to code on it, dropped it on its corners until it wouldn&rsquo;t shut right, and stickered it full with the signposts of my youth. This was my companion, and I couldn&rsquo;t just give it away.</p>

</figure>

<p>Finally, after a year of busyness, I performed the surgery. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Air+13-Inch+Mid+2013+Display+Assembly+Replacement/15407">Removing the upper display</a> was quite easy, but after that I was on my own. Though most of the remaining work boiled down to peeling away the layers, the screen material can get pretty nasty when it cracks! I probably should have worn long sleeves, goggles, and a mask to be extra careful with the &rsquo;exploding&rsquo; glass particles, but it was manageable. Gloves helped a lot. What would&rsquo;ve helped more is if I hadn&rsquo;t cracked the glass&hellip; but it was a fun project overall.</p>
<p>Bit by bit, I removed the bezel, many layers of screen, the hinge, and copious amounts of adhesive tape used to keep it all together&hellip; and voilÃ ! An aluminum memory, all my own.</p>
<p>This computer had a life. And a death. Her name was WilyKit, and she can live on my wall forever.</p>

      <description>Hey everybody, let&amp;rsquo;s talk localization! Today, I want to look at date formatting for Android applications. When you want to display a date in your app, you have to keep in mind that your customers in different locales will expect dates to look the way they&amp;rsquo;re used to seeing them. But while there are a lot of date formatting options on Android, they aren&amp;rsquo;t all robust enough to &amp;lsquo;just work&amp;rsquo; the way you need them to. I&amp;rsquo;ll show you a how to get you exactly the format you want every time.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everybody, let&rsquo;s talk localization! It&rsquo;s a passion of mine that I&rsquo;d like to spend more time on, and I want to share some tips and tricks I&rsquo;ve picked up in my work. Hopefully, this is only the first of many localization posts to come. Keep an eye out for more in the future!</p>




<form action=https://github.com/aormsby/android-l10n-samples target="_blank">
    <button class="button" style="margin: 16px 0px;" type="submit">View  &#39;Android Localization Samples&#39;  on Github</button>
</form>

<p>Today, I want to look at <em><strong>date formatting</strong></em> for Android applications. When you want to display a date in your app, you have to keep in mind that your customers in different locales will expect dates to look the way they&rsquo;re used to seeing them. But while there are a lot of date formatting options on Android, they aren&rsquo;t all robust enough to &lsquo;just work&rsquo; the way you need them to.</p>
<p>So first, let&rsquo;s take a look at two common solutions that aren&rsquo;t as great as they seem. Then I&rsquo;ll show you a how to get you exactly the format you want every time.</p>
<h2 id="localdate-localtime-localdatetime---from-javatime">LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime - from java.time</h2>
<p>These newer Java 8 time classes were built to take the place of the old, clunky <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Date.html">Date</a>, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html">Calendar</a>, and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/DateFormat.html">DateFormat</a> classes - which you should <em>never</em> rely on completely for localized dates because they&rsquo;re junk. But this new <em>java.time</em> library is supposed to take care of all the problems developers had with the old ones. So&hellip; problem solved?</p>
<p>Maybe for Java devs, but this newer library only works with <em>API 26 or higher</em> on Android. Many projects still support older APIs, so these libraries simply aren&rsquo;t an option them. However, if you don&rsquo;t have to worry about that, give these a shot! I&rsquo;ll see if I can spend some time with these in the future and share my thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="simpledateformat---from-javatext">SimpleDateFormat - from java.text</h2>
<p>A <em>ton</em> of Android projects take advantage of <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/java/text/SimpleDateFormat">SimpleDateFormat</a>, and why wouldn&rsquo;t you? Even the Android docs say this class is <code>for formatting and parsing dates in a locale-sensitive manner</code>. Sounds great, right? Well, I think it&rsquo;s a bit of a trap.</p>
<p>Java&rsquo;s SimpleDateFormat is a really attractive solution for anyone who previously tried the DateFormat class and found the formatting options to be really restrictive. DateFormat supports a limited number of <em>pre-determined</em> date-time arrangements, and plenty of desirable options are missing - like showing the month and date without the year. (The year is <em>always there</em>! Augh!! Hair pulling madness.) But with SimpleDateFormat, you can use a string value to explicitly build your own date format.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-kotlin" data-lang="kotlin"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">val</span> myFormat = SimpleDateFormat(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;MMMM dd, yyyy&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// no locale specified, uses Locale.getDefault()
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">val</span> date = Date()
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>println(myFormat.parse(date))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">/* sample output
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">en_US, USA -- December 07, 2008
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">fr_FR, France -- dÃ©cembre 07, 2008
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">*/</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Super easy, right? Well, if you have keen eyes and you&rsquo;re familiar with the date format in France, you&rsquo;ve already noticed the sample output would be incorrect for that region. France puts the day number before the month!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span style="display:flex;"><span>wrong -&gt; dÃ©cembre 07, 2008
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>right -&gt; 07 dÃ©cembre 2008
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><strong>And that&rsquo;s the trap.</strong> The main reason to use SimpleDateFormat is to create your own format, but when you create your own format, it&rsquo;s not really &rsquo;locale-sensitive&rsquo; after all! And that&rsquo;s a bit of a contradiction, I think.</p>
<p>In the end, your hard-coded string is the problem, and no matter what locale your app is running in, that format never changes to match. Now, there&rsquo;s a way around this - you can extract your format string into a <code>strings.xml</code> resource file and add a &rsquo;translated&rsquo; version of the format in the French resource.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">&lt;!-- res/values-en/strings.xml --&gt;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">&lt;string</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">name=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;date_format_1&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span>MMMM dd, yyyy<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/string&gt;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">&lt;!-- res/values-fr/strings.xml --&gt;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">&lt;string</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">name=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;date_format_1&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span>dd MMMM yyyy<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/string&gt;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This works fine, and it might seem reasonable at first. But if your project needs 10 different date formats in 10 different languages&hellip; that&rsquo;s already 100 formatting strings you need to add to your resources and keep track of over time.</p>
<p>If you need that kind of specificity, give it a shot! But I don&rsquo;t think you do, and I&rsquo;m about to prove it. Let&rsquo;s take a look a look at DateUtils - the tool that does all this junk for you.</p>
<h2 id="dateutils">DateUtils</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/format/DateUtils">DateUtils</a> is the absolute <em>bomb</em> for date formatting on Android. It&rsquo;s flexible, robust, and aboslutely <em>is</em> sensitive to your customer&rsquo;s active locale. In fact, you&rsquo;re not even allowed to specify the locale being used when you format with DateUtils, and for the large majority of common date formatting needs, this is absolutely what you want. You want the system to handle most things for you, and DateUtils does this well.</p>
<p>The flexibility in using DateUtils comes from its bitmask formatting flags. They allow you to specify <em>exactly</em> which date or time components you want to appear in your formatted date value, but instead of showing up in the order you choose (like with the string from before), they act as simple on/off switches independent of order or locale. Here&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-kotlin" data-lang="kotlin"><span style="display:flex;"><span>println(
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  DateUtils.formatDateTime(
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    context,    <span style="color:#75715e">// needs a Context
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    myDate,     <span style="color:#75715e">// the Date object to format
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    DateUtils.FORMAT_SHOW_DATE  <span style="color:#75715e">// the format flag for showind &#39;date&#39; (includes year)
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>  )
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">/* output:
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">en_US -&gt; September 25, 2005
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">fr_FR -&gt; 25 septembre 2005
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">zh_CN -&gt; 2005å¹´9æœˆ25æ—¥
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">*/</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s break this down a bit:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>DateUtils.formatDateTime</code> outputs a <code>String</code> value</li>
<li>First param is a <code>Context</code></li>
<li>Second param is the <code>Date</code> you want to format</li>
<li>Third param is the set of format flags you want to apply to the Date</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it! No explicit format strings, no translated format resources, no locale problems! It <em>just works.</em></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how you can use the bit flags to remove the year now.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-kotlin" data-lang="kotlin"><span style="display:flex;"><span>DateUtils.FORMAT_SHOW_DATE or DateUtils.FORMAT_NO_YEAR
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">/* output:
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">en_US -&gt; September 25
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">fr_FR -&gt; 25 septembre
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">zh_CN -&gt; 9æœˆ25æ—¥
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">*/</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>or</code> bit operator takes both of the flags, combines them, and outputs a format with both flags enabled. This works with <em>any</em> number of formatting flags, including things like word abbreviations, numeric dates, showing weekdays, showing time, hiding the month, etc. Here are <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/format/DateUtils#constants_1">all the available flags</a> for you.</p>
<p>DateUtils is truly the most flexible, easy-to-use, <em>built-in</em> date formatter I&rsquo;ve come across for Android projects. If you aren&rsquo;t using it yet, you should <em>really</em> think about switching to it today.</p>

      <title>Using Hugo Modules Instead of Git Submodules</title>
      <link>https://www.adamormsby.com/posts/012-hugo-modules/</link>

      <description>Hey there, folks! I know I&amp;rsquo;m a little late to this party, but it&amp;rsquo;s time I talked about working with Hugo Modules.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey there, folks! I know I&rsquo;m a little late to this party, but it&rsquo;s time I talked about working with Hugo Modules. Sometime last year I wrote a post on <a href="https://www.adamormsby.com/posts/000/how-to-set-up-a-hugo-site-on-github-pages-with-submodules/">How to Set Up a Hugo Site on Github Pages - with Git Submodules!</a>, but let&rsquo;s be honest - that&rsquo;s a lot of work. Setting up git submodules and managing them over time can be a headache, especially for larger projects, and that kind of configuration just brings in a lot of overhead you may not want to deal with long term. For a more manageable project, I now recommend Hugo modules.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-hugo-modules">Benefits of Hugo Modules</h2>
<p>The Hugo module system is powered by Go modules, which I don&rsquo;t really know anything about. Feel free to explore that on your own. What I do know is this &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>Hugo modules are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>quick to configure</li>
<li>less work to implement in your project repo</li>
<li>great for customizing your site&rsquo;s look without needing to fork a full theme</li>
<li>an awesome way to share open-source code for Hugo</li>
</ul>
<p>No more managing git submodules. No more using complex commit/push/pull schemes to work with your site repository. No more confusion about how to modify and build somebody&rsquo;s theme to fit your specific project needs. Everything you were using git submodules for can (and probably should) be converted to using Hugo modules.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-configure-a-hugo-module">How to Configure a Hugo Module</h2>
<p>If all you want is to include a module in your project, setup is super simple. In your project configuration file (<code>config.toml</code> or yaml or whatever), add the path to the module you want to import. For online resources, add a full URL. For local resources, add a filepath.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml"><span style="display:flex;"><span>[<span style="color:#a6e22e">module</span>]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  [[<span style="color:#a6e22e">module</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">imports</span>]]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#a6e22e">path</span> = <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;github.com/aormsby/hugo-shortcodes&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  [[<span style="color:#a6e22e">module</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">imports</span>]]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#a6e22e">path</span> = <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;github.com/aormsby/hugo-custom-layouts&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  [[<span style="color:#a6e22e">module</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">imports</span>]]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#a6e22e">path</span> = <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;github.com/aormsby/papermod-custom&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  [[<span style="color:#a6e22e">module</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">imports</span>]]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#a6e22e">path</span> = <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>A few things to take note of:</p>
<ul>
<li>This example is toml. Yaml has different syntax.</li>
<li>This is just configuration. You still need to initialize Hugo modules. (More on that shortly.)</li>
<li>The order of your modules is important!</li>
</ul>
<p>Modules on the bottom will get loaded first, so keep anything you don&rsquo;t want overridden higher up in the module chain. All conflicting files during module import will use the <em>last file loaded</em>. If you want to override anything from a module you can use this bottom-to-top loading to your advantage. I show an example of this later on.</p>
<p>Next, you have to tell your project that you want to import these modules on build and how to import them. In your terminal, run the following commands in order &ndash;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt; hugo mod init github.com/&lt;your_username&gt;/&lt;your_project&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># initializes the hugo module system in your project (I used my repo URL here, any string seems fine)</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt; hugo mod get
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># gets a reference to the latest version of each module, stored in &#39;go.mod&#39;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt; hugo mod vendor
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># optional, downloads a local copy of the modules</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now when you build your site, the Hugo module system pulls data from all of the paths in your configuration file and makes a build with all of the data from the included modules. This could be extra layouts, assets, i18n data, shortcodes, etc., and it&rsquo;s all included in your site without a whole bunch of extra setup.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the stored module references in <code>go.mod</code> are references to a specific commit on a github repo, not a branch. You should be able to configure these by modifying the references (or perhaps there&rsquo;s a command for it I don&rsquo;t know), but maybe think before you do. If you point to a branch head, for example, every build could pull in new changes you haven&rsquo;t vetted for your site. Sticking with a specific commit hash is probably better here. You can run <code>hugo mod get -u</code> to update references to all of your modules, but keep in mind this does not update the local &lsquo;vendor&rsquo; copies. You have to run <code>hugo mod vendor</code> again for that.</p>
<p>A note on <code>hugo mod vendor</code> - So far I&rsquo;ve seen two benefits of downloading local copies of your modules.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can see all of the assets you&rsquo;re building from local module folders and modify them as you wish. I&rsquo;ve found it nice to play around with theme settings and then save the changes in my own modules to override them. Vendorizing creates a code playground for you in this way.</li>
<li>If you ever want to save a specific module configuration as part of a git commit, vendorizing allows you to include the modules at the state they&rsquo;re in when you last confirmed a good build. It&rsquo;s handy.</li>
</ol>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more you can configure with Hugo modules, but I never needed more than this for a simple site like mine. If you want to explore your options, I encourage you to check out <a href="https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/">Hugo&rsquo;s module docs</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="how-modules-can-help-you">How Modules Can Help You</h2>
<p>As you saw before, I have four different modules I import for this site. Each has a different use case that has helped me organize my site and my assets better, and I want to share them here to give you some ideas on how you can take advantage of modules, too.</p>
<h3 id="basic-theme-customizations">Basic Theme Customizations</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently using the Paper Mod theme as the core of my layouts, but I wanted to customize a few pieces. If I was using git submodules like I used to, making customizations would have required forking the theme setting up a branch for my changes and referencing my entire theme fork as a submodule. But that&rsquo;s overkill for a few small changes.</p>
<p>Instead of that, I created my own module called <code>papermod-custom</code> where I have a few custom layout files&hellip; and nothing else. Seriously, my module only has 4 files. This works because of the bottom-to-top module imports we talked about earlier. First, I import the core theme module that contains the base theme. Then my customizations are imported, and <em>since I named my layouts the same as in the core theme module</em>, any conflicting files are overridden with my customizations.</p>
<p>Boom. Customized theme with little to no effort.</p>
<p>My <code>papermod-custom</code> file hierarchy &ndash;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span style="display:flex;"><span>papermod-custom     #root
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> |-assets
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   |-css
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>     |-extended
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>       |-userCustom.css     # new file, additional styling
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> |-layouts
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   |-_default
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>     |-project-list.html    # new file, additional layout
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   |-partials
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>     |-home_info.html       # name conflict, overrides core theme file
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>     |-social_icons.html    # name conflict, overrides core theme file
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="common-site-code">Common Site Code</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you have 10 Hugo sites that you&rsquo;re managing, and you have the same layout file in each of them. It&rsquo;s an awesome layout file - why wouldn&rsquo;t you reuse it? Well, instead of updating it 10 times whenever you feel it needs a change, you can save it in your own Hugo module that you import into all of those projects.</p>
<p>Perfect example - I like <a href="https://adamormsby.com/404">my 404 page</a>, and I always want to enable disqus comments. I can put those two layout files into my <code>hugo-custom-layouts</code> module and import them wherever I want. Modules make it easy to share things.</p>
<h3 id="additional-elements">Additional Elements</h3>
<p>I like shortcodes, and I want to add someone&rsquo;s public shortcodes to my site. If I start a collection of shortcodes and make it a Hugo module - <a href="https://github.com/aormsby/hugo-shortcodes">like so</a> - I can add them to any project with a quick module import. It&rsquo;s not just true of shortcodes, of course. Any kind of Hugo-supported asset can be thrown into a module for a quick addition to your project.</p>
<p>I hope this shows you that Hugo modules are pretty fantastic to work with and how much nicer they are than git submodules. If I&rsquo;d known that a year ago, maybe I never would have written about git submodules! No matter. We&rsquo;re here now, and that&rsquo;s what counts! Happy coding!</p>

      <title>Advent of Code 2020 - Python</title>
      <link>https://www.adamormsby.com/posts/010-aoc-2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 06:00:00 -0600</pubDate>

      <description>Advent of Code is almost here! Read on for my Python solutions from 2020.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> is almost here! For the uninitiated, Advent of Code is a December-long code challenge with awesome new puzzles to solve every day from December 1st to 25th. The puzzles are <em>hard.</em> But that&rsquo;s what makes them so fun!</p>
<p>You might be asking yourself &ndash; What&rsquo;s so great about a month of code challenges? Aren&rsquo;t most code challenges usually kind of dumb and boring? Yes. Absolutely. Most bite-size code challenges are basically someone online writing a problem they think is clever, but instead it has no basis in reality and doesn&rsquo;t make you think critically about anything. (I do not have a high opinion of most code challenges. ðŸ’©)</p>
<p>Advent of Code is different! The problems are more long-form, are great at educating about real-world concepts, and they make you think - really <em>think</em> - about your implementations, especially when brute-forcing something in your program would result in an hours-long runtime just to get your solution. There were several times last year I thought I&rsquo;d solved a problem only to have to rewrite my code from scratch - mostly when part 2 of the problem asked for something I didn&rsquo;t expect. It&rsquo;s super enjoyable, and I highly recommend you join everyone online this year and give it a shot.</p>
<p>I participated in my first AoC last year, and I had an absolute blast! I sort of taught myself Python while doing the challenges, which may have added significant difficulty, but I think I did alright in the end. Here are my dubious solutions if you&rsquo;re curious. Hope you join me for this year!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey, small announcement! I started an open-source project for collecting user-created Hugo shortcodes, and you can add all of them to your Hugo site as a Hugo module. I filled the starter repo with some of the shortcodes I&rsquo;ve made for my own site, and I&rsquo;d love for it to become a place where everybody can share theirs with everyone. Theme-agnostic shortcodes are best, of course, but I really have no guidelines for additions right now. Let&rsquo;s see where it goes!</p>

      <title>Github Actions - Updated!</title>
      <link>https://www.adamormsby.com/posts/008-fork-and-deploy-updates/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 06:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.adamormsby.com/posts/008-fork-and-deploy-updates/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made some serious updates to my two Github Actions available on the Marketplace, and I want to share with you what changes were made and why I decided to make them.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow, what a year! I mean, 2021 still hasn&rsquo;t been my favorite, but it&rsquo;s been a hell of a lot better than last year. Much more productive, anyway. I&rsquo;ve made some serious updates to my two Github Actions available on the Marketplace, and I want to share with you what changes were made and why I decided to make them.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let&rsquo;s jump straight into the more popular of the two!</p>
<h2 id="upstream-sync">Upstream Sync</h2>




<form action=https://github.com/aormsby/Fork-Sync-With-Upstream-action target="_blank">
    <button class="button" style="margin: 16px 0px;" type="submit">View   on Github</button>
</form>

<p>The changes I made to this action really kicked off a whole new approach to how I write shell-based tools. The first few versions had all the code together in a single script, but as the project grew I found it was getting harder to keep track of the state of certain things. To deal with this, I split each piece of the action into its own small script and now call each step from a master script.</p>
<p>It might seem like overkill for a little action like this, but there are real benefits to this kind of architectural change. More flexibility, better testability, and better readability are just the start. It even exposed for me the fact that syncing from private repos <em>wasn&rsquo;t ever working correctly!</em> So that&rsquo;s been fixed. For good.</p>
<h3 id="test-mode">Test Mode</h3>
<p>Since I split all the scripts, they&rsquo;re now more testable! And you get to test them yourself with the new local <code>test_mode</code>. I <em>love</em> this feature. After configuring your workflow, you want to be sure it&rsquo;ll work, right? Well, if you run your workflow with the test mode enabled, it will run a bunch of unit tests to determine if your configuration makes sense <em>before</em> you ever run your first sync. The action output will show you which tests are running as well as a success or failure status.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/sync-tests.png">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/sync-tests.png#center"
         alt="Upstream Sync test mode"/> </a>
</figure>

<p>While these tests don&rsquo;t cover every possible issue, they do cover the basics. Does your upstream repo exist? Do your branches exist? Things like that. If you think more tests are needed, let me know!</p>
<h3 id="flexible-domain">Flexible Domain</h3>
<p>You can now change the domain from <code>github.com</code> to any other base domain if your sync repo is not on Github. Maybe this will broaden the action&rsquo;s user base? We&rsquo;ll see! Thank you to <a href="https://github.com/mathieucarbou">@mathieucarbou</a> for adding this feature.</p>
<h3 id="fixes">Fixes</h3>
<p>Of course there were some fixes! Nothing&rsquo;s perfect. I mentioned before that syncing from private repos was never actually working as intended, and it turned out that I was having issues setting credentials when trying to access them. So that&rsquo;s fixed! Along with that, there was a request for a GPG signing feature, which actually pushed me to discover and fix another problem &ndash; the git configuration being done by the Upstream Sync action was clashing with other actions run in the same workflow. Also fixed. Did I add GPG signing? No. But this makes it so that you can confidently <a href="https://github.com/aormsby/Fork-Sync-With-Upstream-action/wiki/GPG-Signing">add other actions</a> into your workflow to support such needs.</p>
<h3 id="wiki">Wiki</h3>
<p>Documentation is a good thing, so I wrote a wiki. I felt there were enough &rsquo;non-standard&rsquo; sync scenarios cropping up that I needed write some help docs, and here they are &ndash; <a href="https://github.com/aormsby/Fork-Sync-With-Upstream-action/wiki">https://github.com/aormsby/Fork-Sync-With-Upstream-action/wiki</a>. They aren&rsquo;t super long, and it&rsquo;s worth reading them to get familiar with the changes as well as how to set up for your specific use case if the action doesn&rsquo;t work for you out of the box.</p>
<h3 id="v24">v2.4</h3>
<p>For those of you seeking minimal changes to the actions you use, I released v2.4 as a fix for the private repo issues you may have encountered previously. It also includes the <code>domain</code> input variable. While this should be good enough to get you the fixes you need, please know that I will not make any further updates to v2.</p>
<h2 id="hugo-build-and-deploy">Hugo Build and Deploy</h2>




<form action=https://github.com/aormsby/hugo-deploy-to-pages target="_blank">
    <button class="button" style="margin: 16px 0px;" type="submit">View   on Github</button>
</form>

<p>On to the second action! Hugo Build and Deploy hasn&rsquo;t had such a great showing in the past as its functionality was a bit flaky - but that&rsquo;s going to change! If you&rsquo;re seeing this post now, it means the action did its job building and publishing my site&rsquo;s updates. Inspired by my changes to Upstream Sync, I also split all of the action steps into their own scripts. It really allowed me to figure out what was going wrong with this action as well as update it to follow a more modern continuous delivery pattern when publishing. While I really don&rsquo;t expect the action to need many updates, I don&rsquo;t expect it to cause trouble anymore, either.</p>
<h3 id="test-mode-again">Test Mode (Again)</h3>
<p>Much like the other action, there&rsquo;s a new test mode. Specifically, this action test if your branches and repos exists, but it also <em>crucially</em> helps you determine if you&rsquo;ve set things up correctly for any sumbodules you might be publishing to. Personally, I&rsquo;m moving away from submodule publishing for Hugo websites, and I plan on sharing why in a future post. But I know I lot of you might not be, and I wanted to make sure this action supports your needs clearly and safely.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/deploy-tests.png">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/deploy-tests.png#center"
         alt="Hugo Build and Deploy test mode"/> </a>
</figure>

<h3 id="branched-builds">Branched Builds</h3>
<p>Along with changes to the project, I&rsquo;ve also made big changes to the action output. Previously, the action made site builds and pushed the changes to the same branch it got the source code from. That&rsquo;s a problem because on some level that branch is pretty likely to be an active development branch. For many reasons, modern CD patterns dictate that development and release should remain separate. The updated deploy action fully supports that kind of separation.</p>
<p>Now when you configure the action, you choose your <code>source-branch</code> to <em>pull from</em>, and your <code>release_branch</code> to <em>build to</em>. The biggest benefit of this change is that you&rsquo;ll now have a totally separate branch just for tracking your release history, and you won&rsquo;t have any auto-build commit pollution in your working branches. Good stuff.</p>
<h3 id="wiki-again">Wiki (Again)</h3>
<p>See the pattern here? Good releases have documentation. <a href="https://github.com/aormsby/hugo-deploy-to-pages/wiki">https://github.com/aormsby/hugo-deploy-to-pages/wiki</a></p>
<h3 id="known-issue---shallow-clones">Known Issue - Shallow Clones</h3>
<p>Trying to get proper merges when using shallow clones during checkout has quite a problem. Thankfully, it doesn&rsquo;t prevent the action from working, but it does mean you have checkout with fetch-depth: &lsquo;0&rsquo; and pull the entire commit history when that may not be desirable behavior. See <a href="https://github.com/aormsby/hugo-deploy-to-pages/wiki/Git-Shallow-Clone-Challenge">Git Shallow Clone Challenge</a> for details, and maybe you can help.</p>
<h2 id="reach-out">Reach Out</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m super thrilled to have some regular users of both of these actions, and I do my best to check in on their health every so often. If you have any questions, issues, or suggestions, I invite you to reach out by commenting here or opening an issue directly on these repositories.</p>
<p>In the meantime, what have you been up to? Tell me about it in the comments! Share a link, and I&rsquo;ll read all about it. ðŸ™‚</p>

      <title>Github Action: Fork Sync With Upstream</title>
      <link>https://www.adamormsby.com/posts/000/fork-sync-with-upstream/</link>

      <description>These days, automation is key to saving time and minimizing errors. But if you&amp;rsquo;ve never worked with automation, it&amp;rsquo;s good to start small. This was exactly my thought when I made my first Github Action. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what it does!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[



<form action=https://github.com/aormsby/Fork-Sync-With-Upstream-action target="_blank">
    <button class="button" style="margin: 16px 0px;" type="submit">View   on Github</button>
</form>

<p>These days, automation is key to saving time and minimizing errors. But if you&rsquo;ve never worked with automation, it&rsquo;s good to start small. This was exactly my thought when I made my first Github Action. It&rsquo;s available now on the Github Marketplace if you want to try it out - <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/upstream-sync">Fork Sync With Upstream</a>. Let&rsquo;s see what it does!</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>
<p>Remember my post on <a href="https://www.adamormsby.com/posts/000/hugo-themes-making-modifications/">making modifications to a Hugo theme</a>? We forked a theme repository and saw how to make custom modifications to our local version of it. Whenever we wanted to pull updates from the source repo, we ran a bunch of git commands to pull new commits from the upstream repo and then push them to our fork. Syncing with commands like that is all well and good, but let&rsquo;s save ourselves a little time by automating that process.</p>
<p>The Fork Sync With Upstream action takes care of all those updates for us without any work on our part. At its core, the action is a shell script that runs on a Github server and automatically does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checkout your fork (needed for the sync process)</li>
<li>Set the upstream repo to pull updates from</li>
<li>Check if there are any new commits to sync (and print the commit information)</li>
<li>Pull from the upstream repo</li>
<li>Push to the target branch of the target repo</li>
</ul>
<p>Just add my action to a Github workflow file in your repo, and <em>voila!</em> All that update work you were doing manually is now automated!</p>
<h2 id="running-the-fork-sync">Running the Fork Sync</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve never made a Github workflow before, it&rsquo;s a little bit confusing to figure out at first. (At least, it all was for me.) I recommend reading some of the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">Github Actions documentation</a> to get a better feel for how all the pieces work together.</p>
<p>For those looking for a quick sample workflow, here&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;m using in <a href="https://github.com/aormsby/F-hugo-theme-hello-friend">my fork of Hello Friend</a>.</p>

<h2 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind The Scenes</h2>
<p>Just some extra dev notes if you&rsquo;re interested. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Github Actions currently have to be created as Docker container actions or JavaScript actions. I went with JavaScript because it&rsquo;s more familiar to me, and I don&rsquo;t need to run this action in any specific Docker-simulated environment.</p>
<p>The <code>action.yaml</code> file declares all the input variables needed for the action and then runs <code>main.js</code>. At the moment, <code>main.js</code> exists only to run the shell script <code>upstream-sync.sh</code>, which is where the sync really happens. This could change in the future.</p>
<p>I used both <code>@actions/core</code> and <code>@actions/exec</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/actions/toolkit">Github Actions Toolkit</a> to simplify the functionality in <code>main.js</code>. The shell script is called by <code>exec</code>, which I think of as an &rsquo;easy&rsquo; version of the <code>exec</code> function in node.js. Some of the actions and tools that Github has made are really quite useful.</p>
<p>Anyway, try it out! Let me know how you like it. I&rsquo;m also planning on turning my <a href="https://www.adamormsby.com/posts/000/hugo-shell-deploy-script/">shell deploy script</a> into an action, so be on the lookout for that. And if you like my work, please consider buying me a coffee. Cheers!</p>

      <title>Build and Deploy: A Shell Script for Hugo Sites</title>
      <link>https://www.adamormsby.com/posts/000/hugo-shell-deploy-script/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2020 23:30:00 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; writing code that automates my work. I finally had the chance to do just that, and now I&amp;rsquo;m the proud owner of a shell script that builds and deploys my Hugo site without any extra help from me - and it even works with my git submodule setup!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="shell-scripts-are-awesome">Shell Scripts are Awesome</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I <em>love</em> writing code that automates my work. I finally had the chance to do just that, and now I&rsquo;m the proud owner of a shell script that builds and deploys my Hugo site without any extra help from me - and it even works with my <a href="https://www.adamormsby.com/posts/000/how-to-set-up-a-hugo-site-on-github-pages-with-submodules/">git submodule setup</a>!</p>
<p>So why do this? Well, when I began working with Hugo, I ran across a <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#put-it-into-a-script">rudimentary deploy script</a> in their documentation. Since I was still familiarizing myself with Hugo, it hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me yet to automate the build process, and I immediately fell in love with the idea. However, I could see the script would need major improvements to do what I wanted, and I was completely new to shell.</p>
<p>At first, I struggled a bit with writing shell code (especially keeping things POSIX-compliant for portability!), but I stumbled upon the <a href="https://www.shellscript.sh/">shellscript.sh</a> tutorials and dove straight in. Thanks to those <em>fantastic</em> tutorials, I now have a sweet script to show off and perhaps even a newfound love for the shell. Apart from variable expansion struggles, it&rsquo;s really quite elegant!</p>
<p>I find my <code>hugo-deploy.sh</code> script does help keep builds following a standard process, but I think I&rsquo;ll really see it shine when I get around to scheduling automated builds on a remote server. Exciting!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Be sure to place this script in your <strong>site&rsquo;s root directory</strong> if you intend to use it. It&rsquo;s built with my git submodule setup in mind. But I don&rsquo;t think it would be too hard to modify it for something different.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="order-of-operations">Order of Operations</h3>
<p>From start to finish, here&rsquo;s what the script does.</p>
<ol>
<li>Update the automatic build number (included in the git commit)</li>
<li>Check for any user options (see below)</li>
<li>Check if your active repo branches match your intended deploy branches
<ul>
<li>Production and development branches can both be set</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check if your local repo is up to date (no merge conflicts allowed!)</li>
<li>(Optional) Clear out the site output folder before the Hugo build</li>
<li>Run Hugo build command</li>
<li>Git add, commit, and push to your specified remotes</li>
</ol>
<p>If any point in this process fails, the script exits with an error message detailing where the issue occurred. You&rsquo;ll have to fix the issue before running the script again. Thankfully, most of the issues are quick fixes. If you have to do a merge, that&rsquo;s on you!</p>
<h2 id="settings-variables">&lsquo;Settings&rsquo; Variables</h2>
<p>There are some &lsquo;settings&rsquo; variables at the top of the script that you may need to modify to match your project.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>PUB_SUBMODULE</code> holds the name of the folder where your public site submodule is located. The default output folder is <code>public</code>, which is where I have my submodule for the live site. If you&rsquo;ve changed your output folder in the site config, you&rsquo;ll need to update this to match it. The variable value is relative to the root directory, so if you&rsquo;ve buried your output folder then set the path accordingly (e.g. <code>my/public/build</code>).</p>
<p><code>IGNORE_FILES</code> is used with the &lsquo;fresh&rsquo; option (see below). It acts as an array of filenames that will <em>not</em> be deleted from the output folder if you select the &lsquo;fresh&rsquo; option. It&rsquo;s mostly to protect non-Hugo files.</p>
<p><code>PROD_BRANCHES</code> are the two production branches on which you intend to build and push your site data. The first branch name matches the preferred deploy branch for your <strong>site source data</strong> (in your root directory), and the second branch name matches the preferred deploy branch for <strong>your live site</strong> (the supposed submodule). These are the values the script uses to check your active branches in step 3 above. It&rsquo;s a nice safety check.</p>
<p><code>DEV_BRANCHES</code> works the same way for a development build, which is enabled through the user options.</p>
<h2 id="user-options">User Options</h2>
<p>Sometimes you need a little customization! That&rsquo;s where my included script user options come into play. Hopefully these options can help you out a bit.</p>

<p>I ran into some issues with this script that I couldn&rsquo;t totally avoid. Please be aware of them if you try out my script.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Variable expansion</strong> - I&rsquo;m aware that the variables I use in my various git commands are not double-quoted. (And just in case I didn&rsquo;t notice, <a href="https://www.shellcheck.net/">ShellCheck</a> yelled about them in bright colors.) However, adding quotes or modifying the expansion caused the commands to be incorrectly formatted and resulted in failure. They work as they are now, but I&rsquo;m curious to know if there&rsquo;s a way to improve this. I&rsquo;d love to get advice from experienced shell coders.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In today&rsquo;s post, I want to take a look at how we can keep our Hugo themes up-to-date. &lsquo;But my theme works fine!&rsquo; you say. &lsquo;Why would I ever need to update it?&rsquo; Well, when you download or clone a Hugo theme from its hosted git repository, you&rsquo;re getting its latest version <em>at that point in time.</em> So even if the theme&rsquo;s creator pushes updates to the code - with fixes, new features, and outside pull requests - you&rsquo;ll still be stuck using the version you downloaded before. While this is fine in some cases, many of us want the newest updates so we can take advantage of a stronger, improved theme.</p>
<p>The key to this process is using git submodules to track and pull updates to a theme with just a few quick commands. If you followed my previous tutorial on <a href="https://www.adamormsby.com/posts/000/how-to-set-up-a-hugo-site-on-github-pages-with-submodules/">adding a theme to your Hugo site as a git submodule</a>, you already have a functional Hugo site with a (forked) theme included. Starting there, let&rsquo;s see how to connect our theme to its remote source repo, which git commands we need to update it, and even how to safely make our own custom changes to the theme while keeping it in line with the source.</p>
<h2 id="just-the-updates-please">Just the Updates, Please</h2>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t intend to customize a theme at all, we can keep our workflow super simple. All we need to do is add the theme repo into our project as a submodule and periodically run a few git commands to check for updates. For the moment, let&rsquo;s pretend we haven&rsquo;t forked the theme repo and see what it would be like to clone the source directly. We&rsquo;ll see an example with our fork in the next section.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick refresher command for adding a submodule to our project.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt; git submodule add https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend.git themes/hello-friend
</span></span></code></pre></div><blockquote>
<p>You might be thinking you can simply run <code>git clone</code> instead of adding the theme as a submodule, but our site is already set up as a git repo so that doesn&rsquo;t work here. Git doesn&rsquo;t like having <code>.git</code> files in a subdirectory without a <code>.gitmodules</code> component in the root. For more on that, see <a href="https://wespeter.com/posts/avoiding-git-problems-when-installing-a-theme-to-hugo/">this &lsquo;simple dev&rsquo; post.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the example above, we added our submodule by pulling the theme&rsquo;s source repo directly into our project. With the <code>git remote</code> command, we can easily verify that it&rsquo;s connected to the correct remote repo.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt; cd themes/hello-friend
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt; git remote --verbose
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>origin  https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend.git <span style="color:#f92672">(</span>fetch<span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>origin  https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend.git <span style="color:#f92672">(</span>push<span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><figure class="align-center "><a href="img/simple-update.jpg">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/simple-update.jpg#center"
         alt="one-way update directly from theme source"/> </a>
</figure>

<p>And there it is! With this setup, all we need to do is pull updates straight from the source. From the theme&rsquo;s directory, we run the following terminal commands.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># optional: fetch any updates to view changes before merging</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt; git fetch origin
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt; git status
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">[</span>status output here<span style="color:#f92672">]</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># pull updates and merge them automatically</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt; git pull
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Since we&rsquo;re not making any theme changes in this workflow, we shouldn&rsquo;t expect any merging issues during the <code>git pull</code>. We don&rsquo;t really <em>need</em> to fetch or check the status of the repo, but it&rsquo;s always nice to see incoming changes before we bring them in.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it! Getting updates every so often is no problem if we don&rsquo;t intend to make our own customizations to a theme. But hey - customization is where the fun <em>really</em> begins.</p>
<h2 id="updates-and-theme-customization---a-parallel-branch-workflow">Updates and Theme Customization - A Parallel Branch Workflow</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the scenario - We want to add a Hugo theme, make custom changes, and still to get updates from the theme&rsquo;s original source. The method used above doesn&rsquo;t work here for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>We can&rsquo;t push our custom changes to the theme&rsquo;s source repo</strong>. We simply don&rsquo;t have those permissions on the repo. Our local changes will not be safely stored anywhere, and any pulled updates may not be easily mergeable.</li>
<li><strong>Incoming updates may require merges.</strong> If we&rsquo;ve modified some of the theme files that are being updated in the source, then a simple <code>git pull</code> will not be enough to deal with the resulting conflicts.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thankfully, a more advanced git workflow would help deal with these issues. Remember <a href="https://www.adamormsby.com/posts/000/how-to-set-up-a-hugo-site-on-github-pages-with-submodules/#add-a-theme-to-our-site">how we set up a forked theme repo</a> in the last post? Now we get to take advantage of it. Crucially, the forked repo is <em>ours</em>, so we have full write access to it and don&rsquo;t need to worry about repo permissions. We can do whatever we want.</p>
<h3 id="add-a-remote-repo">Add a Remote Repo</h3>
<p>However, our fork doesn&rsquo;t automatically receive source updates either! Here, an additional step is needed to link our fork back to the source repo. Earlier, in the direct update workflow, we used the <code>git remote</code> command to verify that we had the correct remote repo connections. Running it in our forked theme directory, we see only the fork as our remote.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># my forked repo URLs as an example</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>origin  https://github.com/aormsby/F-hugo-theme-hello-friend.git <span style="color:#f92672">(</span>push<span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>To get updates from the source repo, we need to add a <em>second</em> remote repo - yes, git can do this! We simply run this command in our working directory and check our remotes again to verify the connection.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># add a new remote repo connection</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt; git remote add upstream https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend.git
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt; git remote --verbose
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>origin  https://github.com/aormsby/F-hugo-theme-hello-friend.git <span style="color:#f92672">(</span>fetch<span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>origin  https://github.com/aormsby/F-hugo-theme-hello-friend.git <span style="color:#f92672">(</span>push<span style="color:#f92672">)</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>upstream   https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend.git <span style="color:#f92672">(</span>push<span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Ta-da! Our local theme repo is now linked to both our forked repo <em>and</em> the source repo, which we called <code>upstream</code>. (This is a conventional label, but any name you choose is fine.) At this point, our setup already supports getting updates from the source, but the process is a little different than before.</p>
<p>Normally, when we&rsquo;re updating directly from a single remote repo, all we need to do is <code>pull</code> the data to our local directory so that the local matches the remote. We&rsquo;ll still do that here, but we explicitly pull data from the <code>upstream</code> repo we added. We&rsquo;ll also have to make an additional <code>push</code> to our forked repo - <code>origin</code> - to update it with the new code. Here&rsquo;s how that works compared to the previous example.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/forked-update.jpg">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/forked-update.jpg#center"
         alt="comparison of update methods"/> </a><figcaption>
            <p>Left: simple update / Right: updating with a fork</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Assuming you&rsquo;re still on your <code>master</code> branch, here are the modified commands needed to pull and push the updates.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># optional: fetch any updates to view changes before merging</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt; git fetch upstream master
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt; git status
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">[</span>status output here<span style="color:#f92672">]</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># pull updates and merge them automatically</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt; git pull upstream master
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># push source updates to forked repo</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt; git push origin master
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>With no local changes to our theme, the commands run smoothly with no errors - and we want to keep it that way! Simple is good, and an update process that doesn&rsquo;t result in merge conflicts is always nice. But how do we manage to avoid conflicts if we want to customize the theme? Simple - don&rsquo;t do your work on <code>master</code>.</p>
<h3 id="branching-customizing-and-merging-updates">Branching, Customizing, and Merging Updates</h3>
<p>Although you technically <em>could</em> make theme customizations on the <code>master</code> branch, this increases the chances of having to resolve merge conflicts every time you try to pull an update. It&rsquo;s fine if that&rsquo;s how you want to work, but I <em>highly</em> recommend avoiding it. In my experience, it&rsquo;s often best to keep <code>master</code> sparkly clean and do your dirty work on a different branch.</p>
<p>For example, I do my theme in a separate branch that is always kept in parallel with <code>master</code>. I&rsquo;ve named it <code>working</code>, as it&rsquo;s the branch that I <em>work</em> in. (Not exactly clever, I know.) Since it has all of my theme customizations, it&rsquo;s also the branch that I use when I build my site. Every so often, I switch back over to <code>master</code>, go through our update process, and then explicitly merge any new theme updates from <code>master</code> into <code>working</code> so that I have all the latest features in my working  branch. Visually, it&rsquo;s kind of like this.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/parallel-branches.jpg">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/parallel-branches.jpg#center"
         alt="parallel branch system with updates merged from master"/> </a>
</figure>

<p>This is just one possible theme customization workflow, but we can benefit from a setup like this. For example &ndash;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Our workspace is separate from our update environment.</strong> Getting theme updates will always be a painless process, and we have more control over merging when the time comes.</li>
<li><strong>Commit histories are clearer.</strong> Histories are much easier to read if source updates and custom work don&rsquo;t get tangled up, and this can be super helpful when performing more advanced git actions on a branch.</li>
<li><strong>All the data is on our forked repo.</strong> The customizations <em>and</em> the pulled updates all live on our fork, which means we have full control of the data.</li>
<li><strong>We can test on <code>master</code> before merging.</strong> If we&rsquo;re unsure of how a new feature will display on our site, we can run a build using the <code>master</code> code. It&rsquo;s a nice clean test bed before performing a merge.</li>
</ul>
<p>The drawbacks are much the same as I mentioned in the <a href="https://www.adamormsby.com/posts/000/how-to-set-up-a-hugo-site-on-github-pages-with-submodules/#some-drawbacks">last post</a> with the addition that now we&rsquo;d have at least one more working branch to manage. However, I&rsquo;ve found this parallel branch workflow quite nice after getting more familiar with it. Perhaps you will, too.</p>
<p>Here are the commands we can use to get our <code>working</code> branch up and running. (You can choose a better name if you&rsquo;d like.)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># create a new branch and switch to it</span>

<p>So yes - customizing your theme with this kind of workflow does take a bit of setup, and there are a few extra steps and things to keep track of to manage our code well. However, using git submodules and a parallel branch workflow do give us more leverage over our codebase, and I think that makes the extra work worthwhile. I&rsquo;ve been using this workflow with my site for some time, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d change anything about it.</p>
<p>That said, there are a number of other methods that people use for managing their themes, and it&rsquo;s worth exploring them to see what fits your needs best. I recently read a post about <a href="https://www.hugofordevelopers.com/articles/master-hugo-modules-managing-themes-as-modules/">managing your themes as Hugo modules by Nick Gracilla</a> that I found quite interesting, and I think it&rsquo;s worth checking out if you&rsquo;re looking for an alternate way of doing things.</p>

      <title>How to Set Up a Hugo Site on Github Pages - with Git Submodules!</title>

      <guid>https://www.adamormsby.com/posts/000/how-to-set-up-a-hugo-site-on-github-pages-with-submodules/</guid>
      <description>This blog was made with Hugo, hosted on Github Pages, and harnesses the power of git submodules to separate source code from live site data. This tutorial shows you how I got all these systems to work together nicely and how you can use these tools to take more control of your site.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I made this blog site using the <a href="https://www.gohugo.io">Hugo static site generator</a> because I wanted to build a simple site where I could have full control over every detail - <em>not</em> like using Wordpress, Squarespace, or Wix. With Hugo, I can add and remove templates and functionality at will, and it feels <em>great</em> to have that kind of power. You probably ended up here because you want that, too.</p>
<p>In this post, we&rsquo;ll take a look at how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new Hugo site</li>
<li>Host it on Github Pages</li>
<li>Use git submodules to separate our site&rsquo;s key directories into manageable chunks</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also go over the benefits (and drawbacks) of using submodules in our setup, and by the end of this post, we&rsquo;ll have a new Hugo project hosted on Github Pages and ready for action.</p>
<p><em>Please note:<br>
I&rsquo;ll talk a little about branching inside our submodules later on. To keep things simple, you can assume that I&rsquo;ve stayed on the main &lsquo;master&rsquo; branch of each git module. Also, I work on a Mac so all of my commands are Mac-specific.</em></p>
<h3 id="why-git-submodules">Why Git Submodules?</h3>
<p>Every git project is stored as a versioned code repository (a repo). Git submodules allow us to reference other repos within a project, which effectively puts a project inside a project (or a repo inside a repo). The submodule&rsquo;s code can then be used by the main project, but the submodule <em><strong>maintains its own commit and branch history,</strong></em> which separates the projects and can be a pretty powerful thing.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/explain-submodules.jpg">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/explain-submodules.jpg#center"
         alt="diagram showing how code is included using submodules with a git project"/> </a>
</figure>

<p>In a Hugo project, most of what we see is source data - the raw files we manipulate before building our site. After Hugo builds our site, our &lsquo;ready-to-publish&rsquo; data gets output to the <code>public</code> directory of our project. By turning the <code>public</code> folder into a submodule of the main project, we can treat it as a separate entity with a separate history. Let&rsquo;s see what that process looks like.</p>
<h2 id="install-hugo-and-create-a-project">Install Hugo and Create a Project</h2>
<p>First things first, we need to install Hugo! We&rsquo;ll run through the key Mac commands quickly here, but if you need any more help you can always check <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo&rsquo;s &lsquo;Quick Start&rsquo; guide</a> for more details or information about installing on Windows and Linux.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So far, we&rsquo;ve installed Hugo on our machine and created a new template project named <strong>hugo-gh</strong>. If you&rsquo;re following Hugo&rsquo;s Quick Start guide, you may be tempted to move straight on to adding a theme, running the local server, and seeing your site. We&rsquo;ll <em>absolutely</em> get to all that, but since our goal here is to use git submodules to manage the different parts of our project, it would benefit us to go through some setup steps on Github first.</p>
<h2 id="push-project-files-to-github">Push Project Files to Github</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get our project versioned with Github right away! We&rsquo;ll need to create two repositories on Github - one to host our source code and one to host our live site data.</p>
<h3 id="source-code-repository">Source Code Repository</h3>
<p>Sign in to Github and create a new repository. I&rsquo;ll call mine <strong>hugo-gh-pages-source</strong>.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/github-new-repo.jpg">

    <img loading="lazy" src="img/github-repo-name.jpg#center"
         alt="name the new github repo"/> </a>
</figure>

<p><em><strong>Hot tip:</strong> If we create a repo <em>without</em> a README file it&rsquo;s easier to avoid accidental history conflicts when pushing a local project to a fresh repo. We can always add one later.</em></p>
<p>When our new empty repo is ready, go back to the terminal window and input these commands to initialize our local repo and push to Github.</p>
<p><em>(If you already have a <code>public</code> folder in your project, delete it before doing any of this to save some headaches.)</em></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># 1. Enter the project folder.</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># 6. Push to the remote master</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&gt; git push -u origin master
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And there you have it! Our project source is now pushed to our Github repo.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/source-pushed.jpg">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/source-pushed.jpg#center"
         alt="source project pushed to Github"/> </a>
</figure>

<p>You could <em>absolutely</em> set up your source repo to be the host of your site using Github Pages, and you may have good reasons for doing so. That would require a different setup that you can find steps for on Hugo&rsquo;s <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#deployment-of-project-pages-from-docs-folder-on-master-branch">Host on Github</a> docs page. However, if we do this we ignore our chance to separate <code>public</code> into a separately versioned repo. To accomplish this, we have to create a second repository.</p>
<h3 id="live-site-data-repository">Live Site Data Repository</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s add our first submodule to the project! Remember, our goal is to separate the commit histories of our project source and our site build output to the <code>public</code> directory. First, we create another repo on Github for our public site data. I&rsquo;ll call mine <strong>hugo-gh-pages-public</strong>. In our local terminal, run the following command from the project root.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># my sample URL - https://github.com/aormsby/hugo-gh-pages-public.git</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Sweet! We now have a submodule initialized and loaded into our project under the <code>public</code> directory, and it&rsquo;s already connected to its remote origin. Let&rsquo;s do a quick site build just to put something into the remote Github repo. The commands needed are a little tedious, but it&rsquo;s good to know the process.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It&rsquo;s <em><strong>super important</strong></em> when we build to make sure that we commit and push <em>both</em> the public submodule and the main project. For each submodule commit, the project updates its reference to the submodule to maintain its connection to the correct commit. The <code>--recurse-submodules=on-demand</code> command pushes all of the project modules at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="enable-github-pages">Enable Github Pages</h2>
<p>On Github, our <strong>hugo-gh-pages-public</strong> repo now has some data. Go to the repo settings and find the Github Pages section. Set the <strong>Source</strong> of our site to <strong>master branch</strong>.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/github-pages-settings.jpg">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/github-pages-settings.jpg#center"
         alt="menu to update Github Pages settings to use master branch"/> </a>
</figure>

<p>With these settings, Github Pages will be able to serve our site from the repo starting with the <strong>index.html</strong> file in its root directory. The live URL for the site is built from your user name and the project name. Here&rsquo;s my sample URL - <a href="https://aormsby.github.io/hugo-gh-pages-public"><code>https://aormsby.github.io/hugo-gh-pages-public</code></a>. At this point, our site won&rsquo;t display anything except an error message since Hugo requires some page templates or a full theme to generate the pages. That&rsquo;s fine. We just wanted to add some stuff to Github so we could access the repo&rsquo;s Github Pages settings as we just did.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-making-a-submodule-in-public">Benefits of Making a Submodule in &lsquo;Public&rsquo;</h2>
<p>To recap, here&rsquo;s our project setup so far.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/submodules-diagram-with-public.jpg">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/submodules-diagram-with-public.jpg#center"
         alt="project submodule digram with public folder"/> </a>
</figure>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the benefits of this system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>No accidental deploys</strong> - With our source code separated from our site data, it&rsquo;s a lot harder to accidentally push unfinished work to our live site. Even if we make builds locally and push our source changes, we won&rsquo;t push to our <strong>hugo-gh-pages-public</strong> repo without explicitly running commands to make that happen. <em>*sigh of relief*</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Separate rollbacks</strong> - If something goes wrong, the main project and public project can be separately rolled back to earlier commits. <em>(Just remember to commit the modified reference updates to the main module!)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Branch work is easier</strong> - Changing branches in our source project will not change branches in our subproject (and vice versa). This is another nice safety buffer, and it gives us more options for branching in either module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ready for site staging</strong> - We can easily create development branches in the <strong>public</strong> submodule that could be served as development subdomains of our site and used for testing new features.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-drawbacks">Some Drawbacks</h3>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s always wise to assess the risks of any setup, and there are many opinions on the &lsquo;perfect system&rsquo; in the dev world - <strong>tell me about yours in the comments!</strong> To shine some light on the potential downsides of our submodule use, here are some of the concerns I&rsquo;ve thought about.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Juggling multiple repos</strong> - With more submodules comes more administration. It doesn&rsquo;t seem so rough for me, but right now I&rsquo;m working on my own. Running interlinked, asynchronous repositories comes with its own challenges in a team setting, particularly if someone forgets to push updated submodule references to the source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No site staging with Github Pages</strong> - While the <strong>public</strong> submodule can branch and easily store data used in a site staging system, Github Pages does not seem to support subdomains from different project branches. That&rsquo;s more of a Github Pages drawback, but it means we can&rsquo;t take full advantage of our setup just yet. Another hosting platform might offer a solution - I&rsquo;ll be looking into some options in a future post.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="add-a-theme-to-our-site">Add a Theme to Our Site</h2>
<p>Wait, we&rsquo;re not finished just yet! Remember how our site doesn&rsquo;t display anything except an error message right now? We need some templates to get things up and running. The easiest way to get some is to add one of the many <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">Hugo themes</a> to our project. Since it was the first theme I used, I&rsquo;ll use the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-hello-friend/">Hello Friend theme</a> in my example.</p>
<p>Many guides for adding a theme - including Hugo&rsquo;s own docs - just tell you to clone the theme repo or download and copy it into your project&rsquo;s <code>themes</code> directory. But hey, <em>our</em> theme today is <em>submodules</em>, so I propose that we add a theme to our project as a <em>submodule</em> since doing so would give us some nice dev powers over the theme.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/submodules-diagram-with-theme.jpg">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/submodules-diagram-with-theme.jpg#center"
         alt="project submodule digram with theme folder"/> </a>
</figure>

<p>Look at it this way - directly cloning a theme into our project has two major problems.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>We can&rsquo;t push our commits to the theme&rsquo;s source repo, because we don&rsquo;t have permission.</strong> This means we can&rsquo;t make changes to the theme and then keep them versioned.</li>
<li><strong>A cloned project in a subdirectory isn&rsquo;t linked with the main project.</strong> When a submodule is added to a project, the main project adds a reference to it in a file named <code>.gitmodules</code>. Without that reference, the main project and the theme project aren&rsquo;t connected, which could cause confusion or problems down the line.</li>
<li><strong>Also, Git doesn&rsquo;t allow repos inside repos that aren&rsquo;t submodules.</strong> See <a href="https://wespeter.com/posts/avoiding-git-problems-when-installing-a-theme-to-hugo/">this &lsquo;simple dev&rsquo; post</a> for details.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s solve each of those problems in one fell swoop.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a fork of the <strong>Hello Friend</strong> theme so we have our own copy of it.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/fork-theme.jpg">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/fork-theme.jpg#center"
         alt="fork a theme project on Github"/> </a>
</figure>

<ol start="2">
<li>Add our forked repo as a submodule in our main project&rsquo;s <code>themes</code> folder.</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Add the theme submodule from the root project folder</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Boom! Now we have our own fork of a cool theme referenced as a submodule of our Hugo project. We can make any changes we want and push them to our own repo. I&rsquo;ll get into more advanced uses of theme submodules in another post, but for now we have the basics in place.</p>
<p>Things won&rsquo;t be <em>quite</em> right without tweaking a few final settings, so let&rsquo;s open the <code>config.toml</code> file in our project root so we can modify a few lines.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a line so our site builds using our new theme.</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">theme</span> = <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;hello-friend&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><ol start="2">
<li>Because we&rsquo;re making a Github &lsquo;project site&rsquo; we want to change the<code>baseURL</code> to match our project URL.</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">baseURL</span> = [<span style="color:#a6e22e">GITHUB_USER_NAME</span>].<span style="color:#a6e22e">github</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">io</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">/</span>[<span style="color:#a6e22e">PROJECT_NAME</span>]
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For example, mine will say <code>aormsby.github.io/hugo-gh-pages-public</code>. To understand the difference between setting up a project site and a user/organization site, see these <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#github-user-or-organization-pages">Hugo</a> docs on the matter.</p>
<p>There are a lot more theme settings that can be adjusted in your config file, but you can explore those on your own. Let&rsquo;s deploy!</p>
<h2 id="test-site-and-deploy">Test Site and Deploy</h2>
<p>Running the terminal command <code>hugo server</code> in our project root spins up a local live preview of our site that can be viewed in a browser at <code>localhost:1313</code>.

<li>
<p><strong>Theme Branches and Getting Updates</strong> - I&rsquo;ve worked out a nice branch-based system for continuing to get updates from the original theme repo while adding and changing things our forked theme repo. It&rsquo;s super useful. <a href="https://www.adamormsby.com/posts/000/hugo-themes-making-modifications/">Next post!</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.adamormsby.com/posts/000/hugo-shell-deploy-script/"><strong>Better Deploy</strong></a> - I&rsquo;m sure you noticed that we had to use <em>a plethora</em> of terminal commands to add, commit, and push files to the main project and its submodules to maintain proper commit references. I wrote them out in this post for clarity, but this process is definitely something we can automate. Hugo&rsquo;s docs provide a <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#put-it-into-a-script">basic deploy script</a> to do this, and I&rsquo;m working on a greatly improved version of it that I&rsquo;ll write about when it&rsquo;s ready for action.</p>

<h2 id="the-mountain-of-madness---crossing-thresholds">The Mountain of Madness - Crossing Thresholds</h2>
<p>At first I didnâ€™t realize it was a mountain. All I knew was that I had ridden out past the edge of a small town to a place where the road suddenly changed. It curved back and forth, meandering upward through forested hills, becoming steeper and more narrow as I rode on. Time passed, and the shoulders of the road disappeared. I was forced to move into the auto lane, pressing tightly against the metal barriers along its hazardous edge.</p>
<p>Unlike in Havana or on the autopista, the drivers here did not take much care to avoid me, as if the possibility of a collision wasnâ€™t even a passing concern. When two cars met at my location, neither would pause to let the other pass and then drive safely around me. Even lone passing vehicles would drive dangerously close without slowing down, the worst offenders being the massive TransTur buses that bore down on me from the rear and often compelled me to pause and regain my composure after their passing.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t long before I ceased riding and had to push my bike up the road. The last day and a half of motion had left me exhausted, and my legs were losing this uphill battle. I wasnâ€™t sure how high I had climbed by then or when I would be headed back down into the valley. My view out from the hillside was obscured by tall brush, and the path forward always disappeared mysteriously around the next bend. I continued to believe that I would find salvation around every tight-packed turn, but I was always disappointed. After more than an hour I was still going up.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/gopr1474_fotor.jpg">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/gopr1474_fotor.jpg#center"
         alt="large dead tree standing by a mountain road"/> </a>
</figure>

<p>The afternoon heat grew more intense as the naked sun endeavored to burn away any remaining shade along the road. A quiet enveloped me, and all I could hear were the sounds of my own desperate hike - heavy breathing, the light shuffle of clothing with every step forward, the smack of shoe rubber on road, and the continuous click of my bike&rsquo;s rear wheel spinning against its motionless gears. When I stopped to rest, that quiet became silence.</p>
<p>Sitting beside the road, I closed my eyes and listened to the nothing around me. The stretch of grass I had found was just wide enough to sit facing the pavement with my legs crossed and to lay my bike beside me. Perhaps on any other day this would have been a peaceful place to kick back and contemplate lifeâ€™s many joys, but now all I could think about was the fact that I was clearly climbing a mountain where I had not expected there to be one.</p>
<p>Doubt quickly followed this admission. Did I have enough strength left to cross this mountain? Should I have hitched a ride in the last town? Why am I here on my own? Should I have even come on this trip? It had smacked of hubris to believe that I could wake up one day and suddenly ride 130 miles alone across unknown territory, particularly since my longest single ride before this had been a mere 12 miles over flat land! I had done passably well on the highway, but I certainly hadnâ€™t been prepared to ride over a mountain. I hadnâ€™t been prepared for any part of this journey, and if I didnâ€™t make it to ViÃ±ales before nightfall I would be in big trouble.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/gopr1478.jpg">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/gopr1478.jpg#center"
         alt="Adam lying on the side of road exhausted and drinking water from his pack"/> </a>
</figure>

<p>I sat wasting away in the sun, barely absorbing the rusty blue taxi that passed by only a few feet in front of my face. My muscles ached, and yet a numbness enveloped me as if my brain couldnâ€™t decide whether or not to feel the pain coursing through my body. I felt like giving up. I felt like I was done.</p>
<p>Somewhere inside I knew that was wrong, even stupid to consider, and I did what I could to turn to more practical thoughts. I had already ridden so far from Havana - how could I not finish this ride? How could I even consider stopping now? It occurred to me that dealing with failure here would be much more difficult than the challenge of completing my journey, and I knew that making it to ViÃ±ales was more than an imperative. I had to finish. I couldn&rsquo;t consider the alternative.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my body wasnâ€™t on the same page as my determination. I was already panting just from standing and picking up my bike, and I realized how much the rest of this hike was going to hurt. Breaking the silence once more, I began walking forward. Step by step, foot by foot, I was making progress again, little bits at a time, stopping often to fall to the side of the road only to have to begin again minutes later. At each rest, the same thoughts burned themselves into my waning consciousness.</p>
<p><em>I wasnâ€™t prepared for this.</em><br>
<em>I have to keep going anyway.</em></p>
<p>Forward. And up. And forward. Always forward. The rhythm of my motion took over, and I felt as though I no longer had any real control over my body. It was walking on its own, a mechanical corpse driven by the most basic need to survive, always moving to the next point of rest whether I liked it or not. Whatever pain I felt had been eclipsed by a sheer longing for motion, and it drove me forward under the heat of the Cuban sun. I couldnâ€™t complain - I was tired, but I was moving. At least 2 hours passed with me in that state.</p>
<p>Then suddenly I reached the crest of the mountain. I stopped to let that soak in.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/gopr1483_fotor.jpg">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/gopr1483_fotor.jpg#center"
         alt="view of the downhill road just over the crest of a mountain"/> </a>
</figure>

<p>The discovery of my success was like a shot of adrenaline straight to my heart. I shouted triumphantly into the sky. I took my pack off and danced around in the dirt. I laughed at this mountain road and all of the sweat, pain, and misery I had suffered during my crossing. This new energy faded quickly, but the ecstasy of the moment stayed to lift my spirits for the remainder of the ride. It wasnâ€™t over just yet.</p>
<p>I still had to make it to ViÃ±ales, but now I could enjoy my ride downhill!</p>
<h2 id="finding-a-home-in-viÃ±ales">Finding a Home in ViÃ±ales</h2>
<p>Helmet on and packs tight, I mounted my metal steed for the final descent. From the top of the path I could see a long, beautiful stretch of road heading downward in front of me. It was calling to me, inviting me to let go of the last 3 hours of misery and to move once again with great swiftness. I stepped onto my pedals and cycled forward into an empty lane. I quickly picked up speed and smiled as the wind danced happily against my cheeks, my body arched forward in anticipation of my race to the bottom of this mountain.</p>
<p>The weight of my luggage propelled me forward with a momentum I had not anticipated, and I realized I would have to be careful not to wipe out on sharper turns. A little braking here, a slowdown thereâ€¦ I had everything under control. But still, I was flying! I had such an awesome ride on that beautifully smooth road and a wonderful view all the way down. But nothing was so amazing as seeing the Valle de ViÃ±ales for the first time as I rounded a corner near the bottom.</p>
<p>The mountains I saw were wide and steady, as though they had calmly rolled out of the ground to become the backbone of Western Cuba, and a dense green forest covered everything for miles, from the low valley floor all the way to the tops of those gentle giants. This breathtaking environment was why I had come, and suddenly everything I had gone through to get hereâ€¦ it was all okay.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/gopr1487.jpg">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/gopr1487.jpg#center"
         alt="mountain highway in the sun with telephone wires and mountains in the midground"/> </a>
</figure>

<p>I rode into ViÃ±ales in the late afternoon with a triumphant smile spread wide across my face. I had done it! In less than 2 days riding solo across the countryside of Cuba, I had successfully completed a 130 mile bicycle tour from Havana to ViÃ±ales! Swelling with pride, I rolled into town and searched for the parade that would greet me upon my victory.</p>
<p>Of course, there was no parade. No one but me could be excited about what I had accomplished, in part because no one else even knew. To the locals, I was simply another tourist wandering into a town that already had plenty of them, and they went about their lives without thinking twice about my presence. But I knew what I had done, and I cheered quietly to myself on the way into town.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/gopr1499_fotor.jpg">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/gopr1499_fotor.jpg#center"
         alt="main street intersection in ViÃ±ales"/> </a>
</figure>

<p>That sort of anticlimactic moment can be a disheartening part of traveling alone, but at the same time I knew that what I achieved on my first cross country ride had come solely by my own efforts. I had learned so much about my capabilities in the previous few days, and Iâ€™d had a great time on my ride.</p>
<p>What other people called a â€˜crazyâ€™ idea had instead been an amazing adventure, a journey into unexplored physical and mental spaces within myself that would culminate in an experience unlike anything Iâ€™d ever known. And if being crazy is having an unquenchable desire to explore new territories, to seek challenges beyond the limits of my known abilities, and to charge relentlessly forward in the face of overwhelming doubt and fear - then yeah. Iâ€™m absolutely nuts.</p>

<h2 id="spending-the-night-in-a-casa-particular-or-maybe-just-an-apartment">Spending the Night in a Casa Particular (Or Maybe Just an Apartment)</h2>
<p>I stopped at around 7 PM that first night to search for a place to stay. With the hammock and sleeping bag stuffed deep inside my pack I had dreamed of camping in the countryside and experiencing a night under the stars in Cuba. Sadly, that dream was crushed by the sheer amount of private farmland that bordered the highway for the entire ride, and I didn&rsquo;t want to get in trouble for camping on private land or government property.</p>
<p>Eventually, I came to a little town off the autopista called Paso Real de San Diego where I found groups of relaxed locals loitering alongside the highway enjoying the cool evening air. It was here that I decided to look for a â€˜casa particularâ€™ (private home) to stay in as was common for tourists to do. All of Cuba knew that housing travelers could make them a whole lot more money than their usual jobs, and it wasnâ€™t difficult to find someone who would help me out.</p>
<p>Approaching two young men sitting on a bench, I asked if there were any casas particulares available in the town. They exchanged a few quick words with each other, and one of them stood up and ushered me to follow him. As we walked down the side of the road together I got a feel for the place, perhaps the Cuban equivalent of a â€˜suburbâ€™ compared to Havana. I wasnâ€™t sure if such a thing as a suburb even existed in this country, but the place felt like a more contained civilization rather than a satellite of a large city. I suppose that made sense since I had ridden about 80 miles away from Havana that day.</p>




<div class="google-map">

</div>

<p>We walked from door to door, and my guide asked about a room for the night at every place we stopped. The matrons that appeared all followed the same routine. â€˜Let me go check,â€™ they would say. They would disappear for a moment and return only to say, â€˜Sorry, weâ€™re full tonight.â€™ How many other travelers were coming through this little town? Or were the locals perhaps hosting other Cubans? I wasnâ€™t sure, but this frequent occurrence was rather disheartening as it kept happening at every home where we stopped.</p>
<p>My guide paused for a moment, looked up at the sky thoughtfully, and asked, â€™Do you want to stay with me in my apartment tonight? Only 30 CUC for the night.â€™ And then it hit me - I was being hustled. Surely this was a script my guide had followed more than once before, and perhaps the women along the way had been a part of his charade. I had been led through what appeared to be a town full of â€˜takenâ€™ rooms in order to make it seem like staying at this manâ€™s apartment was my only option. The high price of 30 CUC was a dead giveaway - only a tourist could afford that.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, it would have been a bad deal, but we both knew I didnâ€™t have any other options. Begrudgingly, I agreed to follow him to his home. I was a little salty about the way I had been treated, especially since I didnâ€™t have as much spending money as people seemed to think. I had thought that getting out of Havana would mean distancing myself from the constant stream of grifters preying on tourists who don&rsquo;t know any better, but here I was far outside the city, and I was still a target for the locals. It was frustrating.</p>
<p>However, much of my annoyance wore off as I brought my things into the apartment and settled in. They lived on the second floor of a large complex, and as they ushered me in with smiles and hugs I couldnâ€™t help but be swayed by the universal Cuban charm that I had witnessed many times on my trip already. These people were thrilled to have a visitor, and after the initial greetings, questions about my trip, and obligatory group photos were out of the way, their focus turned completely to hospitality. In mere minutes I had gone from cash-laden tourist to honored guest for the evening, and I knew I was as welcome in their home as family.</p>

         alt="3 people inside a home in Cuba"/> </a>
</figure>

<p>I was hungry, tired, and absolutely disgusting from my day in the sun. The mother of the house practically forced me to take her bedroom for the night, and while I unloaded my bags she prepared a bath for me - a bucket of boiled water and a bar of soap waiting for me in a half bathroom whose door always remained halfway open. I chuckled to myself at the spartan nature of things. This was definitely the adventure I had asked for.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/gopr1421.jpg">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/gopr1421.jpg#center"

    <img loading="lazy" src="img/gopr1423_fotor.jpg#center"
         alt="dirty pants on the bed"/> </a>
</figure>

<p>After washing the grime from my body I sat down to a homemade dinner of various small dishes spread around the kitchen table. There was a surprising amount, and I was worried I might be eating all the food in their fridge. But as with everything else, I accepted that it was being offered to me as their guest, and I was pretty sure they could recoup the lost food with only a fraction of the sum I had paid them for the night. They would be okay.</p>
<p>Filled to the brim with wonderful Cuban food, I headed straight to bed. I never quite know how tired I am until I have a full stomach, and after eating I quickly found out how much energy I had spent on the ride that day. My eyelids were heavy with sleep, and it came upon me so fast that I barely remember spending any time in the bedroom that evening. Perhaps it was for the better. I still had another day of riding before I would make it to ViÃ±ales, and it was only going to get harder as I approached my goal.</p>
<h2 id="day-2---a-long-morning-on-the-autopista">Day 2 - A Long Morning on the Autopista</h2>
<p>Before dawn had come, my host was knocking gently on the door to my room to see if I was awake. I sat up slowly to let the sleep spill off my aching body, and I began to dress and prepare for the day. I had really only packed 2 sets of clothing, so I donned the outfit from the day before to avoid dirtying more clothes than necessary. In the dim light of the room I gathered my bags with the help of my new friend, and we made our way downstairs.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/gopr1426_fotor.jpg">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/gopr1426_fotor.jpg#center"
         alt="sunrise in a small town in Cuba and a bright green porch light"/> </a>
</figure>

<p>Gear secured and pack on my back, I followed my guide through a pre-dawn Paso Real de San Diego. The town was buzzing in the dark, adults headed to their jobs and children on their way to school. The students were dressed in matching uniforms and lined up elementary school fashion along building walls as they waited for their buses to arrive. They stared in awe as I walked past, a strange gringo with so many packs and on a bike headed forâ€¦ where? It seemed I was their bit of intrigue for the morning, and I smiled at all of them as they watched me saunter drowsily through the town.</p>
<p>It was surreal to see the familiar patterns these people created as their daily lives unfolded, and I felt much like a ghost sneaking through the gaps between their motion. I hadnâ€™t existed in their world the day before, and I wouldnâ€™t exist in it tomorrow. It was only for this brief moment in time that our paths intersected.</p>
<p>Upon reaching a main street on the edge of town, I received directions and a fond farewell from my host. Walking down the busy road, I found the autopista just as the sun rose over Cuba that morning and began the second day of my ride to ViÃ±ales.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/gopr1428.jpg">

<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/gopr1433_fotor.jpg">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/gopr1433_fotor.jpg#center"
         alt="sunrise at the end of the road in Cuban countryside"/> </a>
</figure>

<p>It was a much harder morning than I had anticipated. Mostly, my ass hurt. I guess my bike seat hadnâ€™t been meant for long distance rides, but since I had never done anything like this before it hadnâ€™t occurred to me to look into it. My solution was to wrap my sweater around the seat and create a thicker, wider cushion for my bony butt to sink into during the ride.</p>
<p>The improvised sweater pad was nice, but the truth was that I was in pain. I was sore, my thighs were weak from the day before, and my back and shoulders were starting to feel the constant weight of my 20 pound pack. Though I was making progress at much the same speed, the ride was starting to feel a bit like a slog, and my view of the endless highway began to take a toll on my mental state. I knew I still had a long way to go, so I broke the ride into small distances to help maintain my focus. Iâ€™d ride 10 miles and do a quick status check on myself, and after that Iâ€™d ride another 10 miles and repeat. The routine was working, and I stuck with it.</p>
<p>But I was also running out of water. Cuba is not a place where you want that to happen, and pretty early in the day I had sucked my Camelbak dry for the second time on the ride. I only had two bottles left now. At the rate I was drinking I knew I would need more, but finding bottled water in Cuba is no simple task, especially in the countryside far from anywhere tourists might be looking for it. I decided it was better to search for it now before I truly needed it.</p>
<p>I stopped at every spot along the autopista to ask where I could find some agua. Even a place that seemed to be a truck stop had none on hand, and I rode on to search the next town. Everyone I asked directed me somewhere different, and bottled water remained elusive in the heat. I knew that continuing this wild goose chase could lead me pretty far off my intended path, and I didnâ€™t want to add any unnecessary miles to my trip. My search would go on, but it would have to be in the direction of ViÃ±ales.</p>
<p>Worried about my resources, I thought about rationing my water and took only the smallest sips at regular intervals. Thankfully, I didnâ€™t need to do this for long. As I continued along the autopista I came across what was perhaps the strangest rest stop Iâ€™ve encountered in my travels so far. Sitting literally on the edge of the highway was a beautiful little restaurant seemingly waiting for me to arrive. There was a patio with tables and chairs, a back area with an outdoor grill, a classic clay shingle roof, healthy green vines and plants growing everywhere around it, and even a little window with a lovely Cuban woman behind it asking me if she could get me anything.</p>
<p>It was a place right out of a dream! And what made it so strange was that there was absolutely nothing else around it. There were no other buildings, no other people, no cars parked, nothing - just low farms as far as the eye could see, and I began to wonder what this place was doing there in the middle of nowhere. I was the only customer, and it didnâ€™t seem like anyone would join me anytime soon. How I wish I could have eaten dinner there under the stars that night. Instead, I ordered two small bottles of water, and I drank a whole one before I even got back on my bike. Resuming the 10-mile routine I had begun earlier, I pushed on toward the horizon.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/gopr1461.jpg">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/gopr1461.jpg#center"
         alt="dirt roadside in Cuba near telephone wires"/> </a>
</figure>

<p>My excitement mounted when I found the off ramp pointing to ViÃ±ales. I was almost there! In 20 miles I would be at my final destination, and my journey would be a success. Leaving the autopista, I encountered again the gravel and hard dirt roads of the Cuban countryside. This time I was happy for them. The curvy, pockmarked road to ViÃ±ales was a nice change of pace from the monotony of the highway, and I was starting to encounter more people along the way. Shouts filled the air as I passed by the locals.</p>
<p>â€™Â¿Casa particular, SeÃ±or?â€™<br>
â€˜Â¡No, gracias!â€™</p>
<p>â€˜Â¿A dÃ³nde vas?â€™ (Where are you going?)<br>
â€˜Â¡A ViÃ±ales!â€™<br>
â€˜Â¡EstÃ¡ muy lejo!â€™ (Itâ€™s really far!)</p>
<p>How far I had already ridden! If they had known I started in Havana, would they still have tried to warn me about the distance? Or would they think me crazy like all the others? From where I sat, another few miles didnâ€™t seem like so much to go compared to the great distance I had traveled in a day and a half. I was riding high in my seat and pushing on toward ViÃ±ales, and I was ready for my destination to finally reveal itself. It was just around the corner!</p>
<p>Except for that damn mountain.</p>

      <description>As I lay on the side of the road, the afternoon sun bearing down on me and threatening to steal away my consciousness, I could hear the throaty rumble of a motor headed my way. I barely registered the rusty blue taxi that passed little more than armâ€™s length in front of me, leaving a cloud of lead-laden exhaust in its wake. Exhaustion spread through me like a virus, and I sat still in the silence.</description>

<p>As I lay on the side of the road, the afternoon sun bearing down on me and threatening to steal away my consciousness, I could hear the throaty rumble of a motor headed my way. I barely registered the rusty blue taxi that passed little more than armâ€™s length in front of me, leaving a cloud of lead-laden exhaust in its wake. Exhaustion spread through me like a virus, and I sat still in the silence.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/gopr1477_fotor.jpg">

<p>I hadnâ€™t seen this mountain coming, and it had made things difficult. I might have said that climbing it on a bicycle had been tough, but how could I know? I had given up and started pushing the bike at least an hour ago. After riding it through the countryside for 2 days, I just didnâ€™t have the energy to pedal up the side of a mountain.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath in the silence. My body ached, and my mind was numb from the heat. All trivial thoughts had been discarded in favor of surviving this ordeal, but now there was doubt forming in my mind. Lying in the dirt, too weak to fight back against the most dangerous of questions, I couldnâ€™t help but ask myself -</p>
<p><em>Am I strong enough to finish this?</em></p>
<h2 id="how-it-all-began">How It All Began</h2>
<p><em>Click.</em> Tickets purchased. I was going to Cuba for 2 weeks!</p>
<p>Flight secured, I now had the important task of figuring out what I was going to do when I got there. I didnâ€™t want to be the stereotypical Havana tourist, voluntarily sequestering myself at a beach resort or spending my time searching for exclusive nightclubs where I could drink and party all night. Thatâ€™s just not how I travel. Instead, I wanted to interact personally with the locals and to discover what makes Cuba and its people special.</p>
<p>I also wanted to step outside Havana to see a side of the country I might not normally encounter, and to that end I decided to go on a cross country bike ride. I would begin in Havana and ride my bicycle 130 miles (209 km) west to a place called Valle de ViÃ±ales (Valley of Vines), home of the best rock climbing in Cuba. I hoped that in 2 days of riding through the countryside I could gain a more rounded perspective on Cuba, and when I finished my ride I could partake in my favorite outdoor sport. It sounded awesome.</p>
<p>But there was a problem - I didnâ€™t know if I could actually do it. I had never ridden that far on a bike before, and I would be totally alone in unfamiliar territory. I knew I could ride for a little while in the flats of Illinois, but 130 miles across Cuba? And then back? I wasnâ€™t sure.</p>
<p>I pulled up a map of Cuba for guidance. Judging by the few roads I could see, it looked like there was a highway along the north coast of the island that made its way to ViÃ±ales with little elevation change. That was good news. Still, that was all the information I could find, and it made me nervous. There was no way for me to know what the road was actually like. But again and again, I followed the path from Havana to ViÃ±ales, and each time my eyes made the journey my heart skipped with excitement. I <em>had</em> to go on this ride.</p>

</div>

<p>Over the next few weeks I bought all the gear I thought I would need, made arrangements to ship my bike with Spirit, and packed it into a big box for the flight to Cuba. I waited restlessly for the day of my departure, and I shared my excitement for my ride with everyone who would listen.</p>
<p>â€˜Youâ€™re crazy!â€™ my friends said. So I knew it was a great idea.</p>
<h2 id="first-days-in-havana">First Days in Havana</h2>
<p>The plan was to spend 3 days in Havana and begin my long ride out to ViÃ±ales on the 4th morning of my trip. During the day I wandered around well-known parts of the city like Habana Vieja (Old Havana), the MalecÃ³n, and Vedado. It was a lot of fun to explore those areas, and I had a great time conversing with locals everywhere I went. Fishermen, fruit vendors, musicians - I even talked with someone who I didnâ€™t realize was a <em>jinetera</em> (prostitute), but she got annoyed with my rambling and asked if I was going to make her an offer for the night. Realizing my mistake, I apologized and bought her some cigarettes for wasting her time. I got better at spotting prostitutes after that.</p>
<p>When evening came I made friends with the other travelers in the hostel. We swapped our travel stories over dinner every night, and it was really cool to meet people from so many different parts of the world and hear about the journeys they were on. Cuba was the last stop for some, but others would continue on to places like Mexico, Panama, or the USA. With excitement, I would tell them about my grand plan to ride west and climb in the mountains of ViÃ±ales. Like my friends back home, they thought I was crazy to go on such a ride, but I could tell they were also excited for my adventure just like I was.</p>

</figure>

<p>Alas, my bike ride didnâ€™t start quite as intended. I got extremely sick the night before I had planned to leave, and I spent many hours vomiting in the hostel bathroom. I painfully ejected all my food from the previous days, and even though I drank juice and water to keep my fluids up it seemed that I was only adding more material to be discharged minutes later. I was never able to pinpoint the cause of my illness - likely food or water - and it was a dangerous situation to be in.</p>
<p>After 2 days of rest I still hadnâ€™t fully recovered, but I couldnâ€™t afford to lose any more time. No matter how I felt, I intended to make my way out of Havana in the morning.</p>
<p>The next day I woke to the noises of the stirring city pouring in through an open window, and I rolled over to greet them with a groan. The muscles around my core were still tender, and the stifling heat of the room raised my lingering nausea to an uncomfortable level. With difficulty, I forced myself out of bed and stumbled to the balcony in search of fresh air.</p>
<p>Outside, the pink light of the early morning sun shone softly against the dim silhouette of Central Havana, and a light, cool breeze danced its way through the waking city. I breathed deeply as the healing wind brushed across my cheeks and scattered away toward the horizon.</p>
<p>No matter what, I had said. It was time to ride.</p>

<h2 id="day-1---finding-the-road-to-viÃ±ales">Day 1 - Finding the Road to ViÃ±ales</h2>
<p>Finding my way out of Havana was the first hurdle on my ride to ViÃ±ales. I had found a fantastic phone app called <a href="http://maps.me">Maps.Me</a> that provided me with a map of Cubaâ€™s roads everywhere I went. Being an entirely offline map, I was frequently concerned that I would be navigating with inaccurate location information, but somehow it managed to know <em>exactly</em> where I was at all times and provided detailed directions every step of the way. It was pretty incredible, and I ended up putting a lot of trust in the service. Perhaps a little too much.</p>
<p>I put in my destination and told Maps.Me to give me a bike route out of the city. It took about 2 hours to get to the edge of Havana, and the winding route south took me through areas that few tourists are likely to ever see. Stark visions of abject poverty were even clearer here than in the inner neighborhoods where tourist perception remains an outward concern. Ramshackle homes lined every street, their walls crumbling to reveal the truths of life in Havana for all those willing to see.</p>




<div class="google-map">
	<iframe src='https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=15sw3_dsRix07D84KErEOztoO6Mg' width="100%" height="480" frameborder="0" style="border-radius: 8px;"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Peering through windows and holes left by the decay, I spied people going about their daily lives - watching television, having a late breakfast, and even sweeping kitchen floors in an endless effort to keep out the dust of the outside world. But not all homes were so exposed, and while it seemed that many of them suffered from structural failure and even the black char of fires long past, others appeared adorned with fresh coats of paint and cheery doormats welcoming guests of all origins.</p>
<p>It was difficult to understand how each city block could display so many conflicting signs of life and death, yet the dissonance created by the sight of these homes and the contrasting attitudes of the people living in them was a source of intense beauty. Life was certainly not perfect here, not even easy, but the universal smiles with which these people approached each dawn and the will to make things better pushed them forward and brought them hope with every new day.</p>
<p>Leaving the last of these neighborhoods, I continued to follow my map to the edge of the city. Pedaling into an alley walled by seemingly abandoned warehouses, I came across a bridge unlike anything I had seen yet in Cuba. It was narrow, made of solid concrete with wooden fencing on either side for protection. On the left of this bridge was an untamed patch of grass, weeds, and vines. On its right was a large pile of garbage, a landfill of trash bags spilling their vile guts and threatening to flood the bridge if the mound rose any higher. At the end of the bridge was an entrance into the wilds on the edge of Havana. It was a mythical gate into the unknown lands beyond the city, a passage with a character that you could only find in a place like Cuba.</p>

    <img loading="lazy" src="img/gopr1333.jpg#center"
         alt="path leading through garbage dump into wilderness"/> </a>
</figure>

<p>I crossed the bridge cautiously and entered the dark path, but the woods lasted only a moment. Almost immediately I was out of the trees and in the countryside, and the city of Havana had ended with such an abruptness that I felt like I had passed into another world entirely. Open pastures and farmland lined what was now a hard dirt road, and condors circled above searching for meals in the hot sun, getting hotter by the minute. I didnâ€™t know it at the time, but my riding environment would be essentially the same for the next 110 miles or so.</p>
<p>Nearer to Havana were many small, dense satellite towns rife with people in the streets, but as I rode further away those became less common. Most of the path was banked by empty farmland and long views to the horizon, covered by sun and the occasional white cloud. Every so often I would encounter a horse cart carrying a few locals who stared at me as I passed, but most of the time I was on my own.</p>

<h2 id="the-deception-of-mapsme">The Deception of Maps.Me</h2>
<p>The morning had been difficult. I still hadnâ€™t quite shaken the feeling of nausea from being sick the last few days, and I probably hadnâ€™t eaten enough to properly prepare for the ride ahead. Together these problems loomed over me throughout the morning, and my irritation showed itself around midday when I lost a bag at a rough railroad crossing. I trudged over to where it had fallen and decided it was time for a break.</p>
<p>Thankfully, lunch was all that was necessary to get me back on my feet with a smile, but worry began to creep in again as I continued riding across the Cuban countryside. My map was doing an amazing job of keeping track of where I was, but as I moved further West I noticed that the bike trail it had given me was not quite what Iâ€™d thought it was. Upon closer inspection, I saw that it wanted to take me straight through the spine of a mountain range that spanned East-West through the center of the island.</p>




<div class="google-map">

</div>

<p>Riding through a mountain range with an 1800 ft (548 m) change in elevation (twice!) was absolutely not the ride I wanted to be on. I had willingly discarded my original plan of riding along the northern coast in favor of following a map that had more certainty about it, but somehow I had completely missed how difficult this route was going to be. I was in trouble, and I didnâ€™t see an immediate solution to my problem.</p>
<p>Devastated by this new information, I stopped for a break in a little town called ChacÃ³n to ask myself if a mountain ride was what I wanted to do. And that was where my luck began to improve. I was resting under the canopy of a small roadside drink shop when I caught sight of two thin silhouettes approaching from a distance. Cuban riders decked out in team cycling outfits and riding the fanciest bikes I had seen in the country rode up like they owned the place and ordered a few glasses of <em>jugos naturales</em>. They waved me over as a fellow cyclist, ordered me some juice, and asked where I was headed.</p>




<div class="google-map">

<p>When I told them in broken Spanish that I was on the way to ViÃ±ales, they said I was crazy! This was the new normal, I thought. But they also said that I was basically killing myself riding these dirt backroads - there was a much better path waiting for me just down the road. All I had to do was turn onto the <em>autopista</em> (the highway) up ahead and it would take me nearly all the way to ViÃ±ales - no turns, no crappy roads, no misleading maps.</p>
<p>At first, I was a little confused. Wasnâ€™t it illegal to ride on the autopista? It seemed that rule only applied in and around Havana, but that was a detail that I had been missing. Maps.Me didnâ€™t understand that I could have ridden on the autopista the whole way, so since I asked for a bike path it created a route for me entirely without the highway in mind. The Cuban cyclists insisted that I take the autopista the rest of the way and wished me luck on the rest of my journey. I spent the next half hour or so beneath the highway in a drainage tunnel and had some food before getting underway again.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><a href="img/gopr1386.jpg">
    <img loading="lazy" src="img/gopr1386.jpg#center"
         alt="drainage tunnel under highway in Cuba with bicycle next to the entrance"/> </a>
</figure>

<p>The autopista was such a gift! All of a sudden I had moved from dirt roads to the smooth, paved beauty of a highway, and what a difference that change made. Any worries Iâ€™d had about riding on the autopista were quickly gone as I began to understand how it had been laid out. There were two auto lanes in each direction of travel, separated in the middle by grassy strips, and outside these lanes was an extra stretch of pavement meant purely for non-auto use. The outer shoulders may have been lower quality pavement at times, but it was the perfect place for horse carts, pedestrians, and - of course - bicycles!</p>
<p>My pace quickly increased on this new path, and I suddenly had fresh energy as though Iâ€™d begun my journey only moments before. I was excited about the speed and simplicity that the autopista offered, and I was happy that my ride across Cubaâ€™s countryside was steadily improving. Though my route had changed many times already, I was still on my way to ViÃ±ales. And I was having a great time.</p>
